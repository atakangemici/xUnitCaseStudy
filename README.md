## Case Study: xUnit Test

### Introduction

The flow proceeds as follows:

Name Input: The user is asked for their name. If the name is empty or shorter than 3 characters, an error message is displayed and the process is stopped.

Surname Input: The surname is requested, and similarly, its validity is checked. If the surname is invalid, an error message is displayed and the process is stopped.

Phone Number Input: The user is asked to enter their phone number. If the phone number is not 10 digits long, an error message is shown and the process is stopped.

Password Input: Finally, the user is asked for their password. If the password is shorter than 8 characters, it is considered invalid, and an error message is displayed.

Success Message: If all steps are completed successfully, a "Registration successful" message is shown to the user.

This flow includes basic validation checks to ensure the accuracy of the information provided by the user.
